# Notte is here
<br>
I just made a very simple program that prints out notte (yay!) <br> <br>
Note, theres an import os that just acesses the comand promt propeties and just makes it big, so i dont think you gotta be scared about kernel32 c: <br> <br>
In order for that os function to work anyways it needs to run as admin, i dont know how to have it ask you for that since i looked up how to do this online from stack exchange (lol) <br> <br>
If you want to, you can change the source code (yes its like 20 lines with 4000 bit string in a line) to have it ask for admin priveleges on execution , just have pyinstaller to easily make the exe file <br> <br>
